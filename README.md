# Neo4j integration tutorial

## <span style="color:#ff5f27;">üóíÔ∏è Architecture:</span>
2. **Feature Pipeline**: Collect and process data and insert into feature groups
3. **Training Pipeline**: build a feature view, training dataset split, train a model and save it in the Model Registry.
4. **Inference Pipeline**: retrieve a trained model from the model registry and use it for batch inference.

You will load data into the **Feature Store**, create `Feature Groups` from which you will make a `Feature View` and `Training Dataset`.

Then you will train a model to predict the distance between nodes.
